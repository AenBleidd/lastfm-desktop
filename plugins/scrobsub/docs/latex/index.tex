\section{Introduction}\label{index_intro_sec}
Win32 library for writing media player plugins that submit listening data to the Last.fm client.\section{Installation}\label{index_install_sec}
The library consists of only three source files, so the easiest way of using them would be to simply include them in your project and compile them alongside your other code. The only class with a public interface is the \doxyref{ScrobSubmitter}{p.}{class_scrob_submitter}.

Files needed: \begin{itemize}
\item \doxyref{ScrobSubmitter.h}{p.}{_scrob_submitter_8h-source} \item ScrobSubmitter.cpp \item BlockingClient.h \item BlockingClient.cpp \item EncodingUtils.h \item EncodingUtils.cpp\end{itemize}
\section{Dependencies}\label{index_dep_sec}
Win32 and Winsock2. Add ws2\_\-32.lib to you list of additional linker dependencies.
