Build Instructions
==================
./configure && make

If that didn't work it's because:-


Build Dependencies
==================
* Qt >= 4.4 (built with Phonon if you want sound :P)
* Ruby
* Perl

Qt is readily available as a simple binary installer on all platforms.

You will also need depending on your chosen platform:-

Linux
-----
* pkg-config
* taglib
* libsamplerate
* fftw3
* libmad

Possibly you'll have to play around to get a phonon that works with KDE4 and 
Qt. I can't help you there I'm afraid. An example Ubuntu installation would 
probably go:

	sudo apt-get install qt4-dev pkg-config libtag libsamplerate libfftw3 libmad
	./configure && make -j2 && make install

I wrote that from memory as I'm working on a Mac today. If it's wrong please
write and correct me. KTHXBAI.

Mac OS X
--------
We suggest you grab the Qt 4.4 dmg installer from the Qt website. Then, the
easiest way to install the additional dependencies is with MacPorts:-

	sudo port install taglib libsamplerate fftw-3 libmad

Windows
-------
We only build via cygwin. You will also need the latest Windows SDK. We tend
to build using Visual Studio. But in theory MinGW and its alternatives should
work fine. Good luck with building on Windows. It's hard!


Build Support
=============
We support developers trying to build the source on any platform. 

Seeing as we don't provide many varieties of binary package on Linux, we also
support non-developers building from source there. However within reason!
Please check around the net a little first. Ask your friends. Demand help
from people standing at bus-stops.

Maybe check the official forum: http://www.last.fm/forum/34905
