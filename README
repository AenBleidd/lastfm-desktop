Build Instructions
==================
./configure && make

Build Dependencies
==================
Windows
-------
cygwin -- tar, perl, ssh, svn, gzip, etc.
The latest Windows SDK.
Qt 4.4 (built with Phonon support if you want sound :P)

Mac OS X
--------
Install Qt-4.4.
Install MacPorts
$ sudo port install taglib libsamplerate fftw-3 libmad


Linux
-----
pkg-config, taglib, libsamplerate, fftw3, libmad, Qt4.4

Possibly you'll have to play around to get a phonon that works with KDE4 and 
Qt. I can't help you there I'm afraid.

Build Support
=============
We support developers trying to build the source on any platform. 

Seeing as we don't provide many varieties of binary package on Linux, we also
support non-developers building from source there. However within reason!
Please check around the net a little first. Ask your friends. Demand help
from people standing at bus-stops.

Maybe check the official forum: http://www.last.fm/forum/34905

Bugs
====
If you find a bug in the software, please let us know about it.
